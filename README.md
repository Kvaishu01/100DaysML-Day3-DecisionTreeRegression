📅 Day 3 of My 100-Days Machine Learning Challenge 🚀

Today’s Algorithm: Decision Tree Regression 🌳

🔍 Goal: Predict salaries based on years of experience.
🛠 Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

💡 About Decision Tree Regression:
- Splits data into intervals and predicts values by averaging within each split.
- Captures non-linear relationships without needing feature scaling.
- Easy to visualize and interpret compared to other ML models.

📊 Result:
- Step-like prediction curve (tree-based fitting).
- Predicted salary for 6.5 years → ~₹ (from script output).
